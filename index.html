                            <p class="!leading-relaxed 2xl:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base leading-relaxed dark-gray lora-400">I see the universe as my main teacher, along with every person I encounter on my path. Everyone teaches me something new. I observe patterns, actions, and their consequences in the world around me.</p>
                         
                            <p class="!leading-relaxed 2xl:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base leading-relaxed dark-gray lora-400">I've never had formal training in the traditional sense. My only brush with structured learning was a brief six-week online course with <a class="underline link" target="_blank" href="https://andy-porter.co.uk/">Andy Porter</a>, and that's it. I believe this gives me a unique edge. Often, formal education can box you into a set of rigid beliefs. But beliefs should be like water, flowing and adapting. Those who cling to outdated beliefs can stunt their own spiritual growth and limit their ability to guide others.</p>
                            <p class="!leading-relaxed 2xl:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base leading-relaxed dark-gray lora-400">I must give credit to <a class="link underline" target="_blank" href="https://paigegarciaqh.com/">Page Garcia</a> and the group of women present in our group healings as well. My experience with them was transformational. The person I was when I met them and the person, I am now, are two completely different people. You are all very talented in your work - thank you for the love and guidance you have given me.</p>
                            <p class="!leading-relaxed 2xl:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base leading-relaxed dark-gray lora-400">Born in May 1986 in a small Ohio town near Akron, my early years were tough. My childhood was clouded, marked by struggles, leading me into a battle with addiction later on. </p>
                        
                       
                       
                        <p class="!leading-relaxed 2xl:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base leading-relaxed dark-gray lora-400">Yet, this dark period shaped me, and I regret none of it. I've been clean since February 2018, and at 33, I embarked on an academic journey, earning a bachelor's degree in IT by May 2023.</p>
                        <p class="!leading-relaxed 2xl:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base leading-relaxed dark-gray lora-400">By day, I'm a developer, and I genuinely enjoy coding. It's not just work; it's where I get to be creative, to build stuff that people can see and use. It's my way of putting my mark on the world, and that feels pretty damn good.</p>
                        <p class="!leading-relaxed 2xl:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base leading-relaxed dark-gray lora-400">When the workday ends and the weekend hits, I switch gears to focus on healing. It's not just a hobby; it's like a calling. I spend those quiet hours diving deep into meditation, searching for peace inside myself and working on energy healing. It's my time to recharge and help heal, whether it's me or someone else.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <h2 class="2xl:text-6xl lg:text-5xl text-4xl !font-bold text-dark-gray-60 playfair-display-500 neg-letter">My Healing Journey</h2>
                    <p class="!leading-relaxed 2xl:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base leading-relaxed dark-gray lora-400">I remember watching Tyler Henry the medium for the Stars when I was in my active addiction. I would get goosebumps watching him and at that time I didn’t feel anything. I even cried in happiness. Watching him was the only time I felt anything. Something inside of me activated. I didn’t know it at the time, but my soul was trying to reach me. That was the catalyst of my healing journey. </p>
                    <p class="!leading-relaxed 2xl:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base leading-relaxed dark-gray lora-400">In August 2019, I experienced my initial spiritual awakening, which unfortunately veered off course. Unaware at the time, a negative entity had been influencing me since my early years. During this period, I was under the illusion that I was in telepathic communication with a famous personality. It turned out I was engaging with this malevolent entity instead. This misconception lasted several months until I made the deliberate decision to stop it, recognizing the detrimental impact of this energy. By choosing to no longer believe in this interaction, I was able to sever the connection.</p>
                    <p class="!leading-relaxed 2xl:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base leading-relaxed dark-gray lora-400">During this period, I found myself wielding what felt like superhuman abilities, which came naturally through engaging with this malevolent entity. However, I was employing these powers in ways that violated universal laws. Eventually, I abandoned these capabilities, understanding their origin was malevolent. My higher self later revealed that relinquishing these powers was a critical step towards my next spiritual phase. Having lived most of my life in shadow, I recognized the darkness well; this time, I chose to ascend beyond it, leaving it behind for good. </p>
                    <p class="!leading-relaxed 2xl:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base leading-relaxed dark-gray lora-400">Following that ordeal, I sought out a psychic reader. She discovered the entity that had shadowed me from childhood and freed me from its grasp. That very day marked the beginning of my second life. After nearly a decade without employment, I landed my first job, and I moved into my own place, where I reside to this day. The identity of that psychic has slipped my memory, but my gratitude towards her remains undiminished.</p>
                    <p class="!leading-relaxed 2xl:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base leading-relaxed dark-gray lora-400">In March 2020, my spiritual journey took another turn. That's when I encountered Paige through a community on Facebook. My awakening was well underway, yet I was plagued by lingering negative entities, evident from my peculiar behavior. Paige introduced me to a QHHT session, and shortly after, a profound sense of relief washed over me. I will never forget afterwards; I had this big blood blister on the inside of my cheek in my mouth. Paige said that was the darkness leaving my body and I believed her. </p>
                    <p class="!leading-relaxed 2xl:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base leading-relaxed dark-gray lora-400">Not long after, I began participating in group healing sessions led by Paige, along with a circle of women. This felt like the nearest I'd come to formal training in the spiritual arts. I attended each session diligently for an entire year, and during that period, I absorbed the most valuable lessons of my journey.</p>
                    <p class="!leading-relaxed 2xl:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base leading-relaxed dark-gray lora-400">In September 2023, I encountered a setback—a traumatic event that spiritually reset me to square one. Trauma has a way of sealing our heart centers, shifting our energy towards negativity. Reopening the heart and realigning with positivity is no small feat. Since that September, I've been on a path of recovery, only now beginning to emerge from the shadows. This ordeal was my dark night of the soul; at my peak, I had grown complacent, content with the knowledge I held, ceasing to seek further wisdom—a critical error. We must always pursue learning. The challenge pushed me to acquire new healing tools, starting with self-healing. A dark night of the soul serves to propel us into uncomfortable territories, where true growth occurs. For much of the past year, I've been mired in negativity, but now, I'm poised to progress. Through this ordeal, I've gained profound insights, discovered my true self, and recognized my capabilities—insights that are unshakable.</p>
                    <h2 class="2xl:text-6xl lg:text-5xl text-4xl !font-bold text-dark-gray-60 playfair-display-500 neg-letter">My Abilities</h2>
                    <p class="!leading-relaxed 2xl:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base leading-relaxed dark-gray lora-400">My most profound ability is communicating with the higher self, or soul, a skill honed through encounters with my many 'walk-ins'. (A walk-in happens when one's current soul is switched for another from their soul star.) I've undergone this transformation multiple times, with my first in 2015. Walk-ins typically occur post near-death experiences or when one's internal vibration significantly increases, surpassing the body's current frequency. Our soul aligns with our vibration, whether it's high or low. A soul vibrating at a high frequency can't sustain in a lower frequency body, hence, a matching soul is provided. Soul replacements are more common than we realize; I estimate around 80% of people have experienced this phenomenon, likely more than once.</p>
                    <p class="!leading-relaxed 2xl:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base leading-relaxed dark-gray lora-400">Your higher self is privy to every detail about you, holding your deepest secrets without a shred of judgment. They embody pure love and comprehension, serving as your eternal supporter, encouraging you never to surrender. My capacity to connect with YOUR higher self unlocks your path to healing. Together, with my skills and your higher self's guidance, your journey towards recovery is within reach. It's the moment to welcome this transformative voyage.</p>
